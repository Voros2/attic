# The Attic

Here, you will find all the resources that were 
present in earlier versions of _Freedoom_, until they 
were replaced with more suitable assets.

The attic is the place to get various assets you 
wouldn't normally find in any other websites, such 
as the [Realm 667 website](http://www.realm667.com).

We encourage you to use these assets, whether natively
or as a base for modification. In return, please credit 
the _Freedoom_ project or/and the author himself/herself.

In the meantime, a quick look at what you can find here:
