# The Attic
Here, you will find all the resources that were 
present in earlier versions of Freedoom, until they 
were replaced with more suitable assets.

The attic is the place to get various assets you 
wouldn't normally find in any other websites, such 
as the [Realm 667 website](http://www.realm667.com).

We encourage you to use these assets, whether natively
or as a base for modification. In return, please credit 
the _Freedoom_ project or/and the author himself/herself.

In the meantime, a quick look at what you can find here:

And more!
